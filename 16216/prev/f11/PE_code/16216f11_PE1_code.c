/*
 * 16.216: ECE Application Programming, University of Massachusetts Lowell
 * Instructor: Dr. Michael Geiger
 *
 * 9/23/11: Programming Exercise 1
 * Program is intended to give students practice with output formatting
 *   as well as experience using debugger
 *
 * Given: a simple resistive DC voltage divider consisting of a 10V source and two 
 *   resistors, one of which is known to be 1000 ohms.
 * Program should read four possible values for the second resistor (max: 5000 ohms)
 *   and calculate what the following quantities would be if each value was used in the divider:
 *      --> The voltage drop across the second resistor
 *      --> The current flowing through the second resistor
 *      --> The power dissipated by the second resistor
 * Program should prompt user to enter desired precision for all data, then print data in tabular form.
